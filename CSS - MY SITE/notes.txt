z-AXIS
=======
children element sit on top of parent element

POSITION - 
============= 
            STATIC - (DEFAULT)

            RELATIVE - from where it would have been in static POSITION
            (LEFT 30PX MEANS pushed 30px space from left   [top left bottom right]),
            [no effect on any other element]

            ABSOLUTE - relative to parent  (then it is not considered in flow - can move anywhere)
            adds margin a 30px inside parent element

            FIXED - sticks to POSITION mentioned

Center
=======
text-align:Center
elements not having   width  will be centered
  [works with inline-block(img) element and block(h1,p) element]

centering using margin
========================
auto will keep it center
